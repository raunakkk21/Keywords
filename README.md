| Forward Proxy  | Reverse Proxy |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| It accepts connections from computers on a private network and forwards those requests to the public internet.   | Public access point for users to access data and information that is stored on servers that reside in a private, isolated subnet.  |
| Acts as single point of exit for subnet users who want to access resources outside of their private network.  | Acts as a single point of entry for external systems to access resources on a private subnet.  |
| Banks and insurance companies, and government agencies use it to protects corporate computers from outside attacks from this isolation  | Large websites and content delivery networks to balance the load between internal servers.  |

- Blockchain helps in the verification and traceability of multistep transactions needing verification and traceability.
- Blockchain uses the three principles of cryptography, decentralization, and consensus to create a highly secure underlying software system that is nearly impossible to tamper with.
#### Currency
- Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions in a network. Cryptography is also used to manage and control the creation of such currencies : *Bitcoin and Ethereum*
- Virtual currencies are a form of digital currency. They are issued by private parties, such as a group of developers or organizations, and are intended only for online use
 - *ICO* - An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry's equivalent of an initial public offering (IPO) used in order to raise capital

38. **Types of Computing**
- *Desktop Computing* - Desktop computing devices include workstations, personal computers, and network computing devices. A workstation or desktop personal computer does not have many resource restrictions when connected to a fixed network.
- *Centralised Computing* - System where all processing and data storage is handled by a single, central device or system which is responsible for processing all requests and managing all data, and all other devices in the system are connected to it.
  - Used in Traditional Mainframe (data repository, or hub connected through terminals) systems, Network Servers
- *Decentralised Computing* - In decentralized systems, every node makes its own decision. The final behavior of the system is the aggregate of the decisions of the individual nodes. There is no single entity that manages request
  - Blockchain, Decentralized databases – Entire databases split into parts, Cryptocurrency
- *Distributed Computing* - It is a collection of computer programs that utilize computational resources across multiple, separate computation nodes to achieve a common, shared goal. It relies on separate nodes to communicate and synchronize over a common network.
  - SOA-based systems(service-oriented-architecture) {CRM, ERP}, Multiplayer online games
- *Edge Computing* - It allows smart applications and devices to respond to data almost at the same time which is important in terms of business ad self-driving cars.It has the ability to process data without even putting it on a public cloud, this ensures full security.
  - Use Cases - In-hospital patient monitoring, Virtualised radio networks and 5G (vRAN), Cloud gaming
39. **Port Forwarding** - It allows computers or services in private networks to connect over the internet with other public or private computers or services.

40. **Cluster** - a group of inter-connected computers or hosts that work together to support applications and middleware (e.g. databases). each computer/host referred as node and each node is assigned same task which help in efficiency and load balancing
41. **Design Patterns** - A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples.
42. REST API
    |**REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.**|
    |------|
    |When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text.|
