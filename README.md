Hyperscale cloud computing is a multi-tenant platform that allows users to access computing resources on-demand. These resources are available globally over the internet, enabling users to provision and scale resources instantly.
**Protobuf** - Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source data format developed by Google. It's used to serialize structured data for storage and communication over a network. Protobuf is great for the following reasons: 
- Low data volume
- Persistence
- Backward-compatible serialization
67. **KubeVirt** - KubeVirt is an open-source project that allows virtual machines (VMs) and containerized workloads to coexist within Kubernetes clusters.
  KubeVirt allows you to: 
- Provision, manage, and control VMs simultaneously with container resources
- Integrate with existing Kubernetes deployments seamlessly
- Run VMs within regular Kubernetes pods
- Access standard pod networking and storage
- Manage VMs using standard Kubernetes tools such as kubectl
- Run full virtual machines on Kubernetes alongside regular containers
68. **Libvert** - Open SOurce developed by Redhat to manage virtualization. It can be used to manage
  - KVM - Open Source Hypervisor for Linux
  - XEN - Type I Hypervisor currently developed by Linux Foundation
  - ESXi (From VMware)
**PAT** - Port Address Translation (PAT) is a network device feature that translates TCP or UDP communications between hosts on a private network and hosts on a public network. PAT allows a single public IP address to be used by many hosts on the private network. PAT works by: 
- Assigning each device a unique port number
- Routing incoming traffic accordingly
**IaC** - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a DevOps practice that uses code to manage and provision infrastructure. It allows developers and operations teams to automatically manage and provision infrastructure through code.
**HCL** - HCL stands for HashiCorp Configuration Language. It's a configuration language that's designed to be both human and machine-readable. It's used in infrastructure automation to help developers write and deploy cloud resources across multiple platforms.
